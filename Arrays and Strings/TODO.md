- [x] remove all the binaries from the commit

- [ ] write a cmake to compile all files and generate all corresponding binaries with appropriate names in `bin/` dir

- [ ] can all the prior commits be renamed to something like `chapter_number dot question_number commit_message`? 
example : "1.4 Palindrome permutation"

>(if so, one can make a gerrit like system where `chapter_name.question_number` can become a hyperlink)

- [ ] pick individual files and do the changes enlisted in the paper, see if those commits can be changed?
